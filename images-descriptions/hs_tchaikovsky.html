        <p>This is an abstract painting that was created based off of the first movement of Tchaikovskyâ€™s Piano Concerto no. 1. My abstract paintings based off of classical music were inspired by an exhibit I saw at the Toledo Museum of Art in which art pieces that were already created were paired with music that best fit the energy of the piece. This piece was self-directed.  </p>
