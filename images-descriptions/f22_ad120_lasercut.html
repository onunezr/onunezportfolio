        <h3><i>DIMENSIONS:</i> n in x n in x n in</h3>
        <p>This piece was the result of an exercise in which I was instructed to construct a 3D object from a 2D plane, and it was my first ever time working with a laser cutter. I created a series of abstract shapes on Adobe Illustrator, later sending the vector file to a laser cutter which in turn cut and engraved into a large piece of taskboard, which ended up being arranged to create a three-dimensional form. This was a valuable exercise as it helped me learn more about the importance of both positive and negative space, as well as practice abstraction, which is something that I have been incredibly intimidated by in the past.</p>
