        <p>After painting different parts of la lotería previously, I continued to incorporate la lotería into my artwork. The second lotería card is “El Diablito,” or “The Devil,” so I made a print out of this card, but with the devil wearing an ICE agent uniform. I printed this onto shirts and sold them, donating the profits to various organizations such as Organized Communities Against Deportation and Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights, supporting undocumented families during the pandemic and providing them with legal assistance. The treatment of undocumented individuals at detention camps is atrocious, and I believe that it is important that I use my voice as an artist to help in any way that I can. This was a self-directed piece.</p>
