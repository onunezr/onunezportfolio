        <p>This installation began with a dead deer that I would drive by frequently. As the weeks passed by, I watched it slowly decompose, which led me to think about our mortality, and how we eventually go back into the Earth once we die. I portrayed this in my installation by surrounding the bones of the deer with mushrooms and flowers, also showing how there is almost a beauty to going back into the Earth once we die. I also incorporated an abandoned ball of yarn covered in moss, which I thought was an incredible example of going back into the Earth, as well as an abandoned bird’s nest, which could be our body without our soul. The flowers were added also with the intention of catching your eye, and giving you an attachment to the piece – once you see it, you do not want to let go of it, although you have to eventually, as you do with a loved one when they’re gone. This installation is meant to slowly decay, and will eventually disappear. This piece was a class assignment.</p>
