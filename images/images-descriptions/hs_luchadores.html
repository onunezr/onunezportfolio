        <p>This triptych focuses on the toxic masculinity present in Mexico, which is largely perpetuated through Catholicism. Mexican men are forced to adhere to the role of the breadwinner, and of being tough and macho, which is why I used luchadores to depict this expectation of strength in men. Catholicism also plays a large role in this, hence the golden halos in the paintings. The voices of women are suppressed in Catholicism, and these gender roles are perpetuated from generation to generation. Although hope for change is growing, progress is slow, leading to hopelessness in most. In the first painting (left), you see a luchador with a sad stare, appearing to be stuck in one place. In the second one (middle), you see a luchador looking into the distance, as if longing for change. In the third (right), you see a luchador and his son, representing the passing of toxic masculinity to the next generation. This piece was self-directed.</p>
