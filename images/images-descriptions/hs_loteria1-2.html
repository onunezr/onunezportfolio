        <p>This diptych is ultimately what inspired me to explore my cultural identity through art. La Lotería originated in Europe in the fifteenth century and was brought to the Americas later on, becoming an iconic part of Mexican culture. I used vibrant colors and gold leaf on this piece because of the vibrant colors used in Lotería cards, as well as the bright colors of Mexico – bright colors are found in the flora and fauna, the food, the marketplace, and the cultural clothing just to name a couple instances. In these two paintings, another important theme is the duality of life and death in Mexican culture. When Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is celebrated, altars are made to honor loved ones who have died, but it is a holiday of celebration rather than mourning. In Lotería I (left) you see a virgin with her face painted as a candy skull, while in Lotería II (right) you see a skull and crossbones, which is depicted in the 48th Lotería card, La Calavera. This piece was self-directed.</p>
