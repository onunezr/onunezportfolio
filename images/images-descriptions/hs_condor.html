        <p>This piece reflects Operation Condor, which was an operation of American intervention against communism in Latin America during the 1970â€™s. Various people were killed and disappeared during that time, and my grandparents had to flee Argentina during that time due to the political persecution. This piece depicts an Andean condor chasing an hornero from its nest. The condor represents oppression from the American government along with the right wing military regimes in South American countries, and the hornero, being the national bird of Argentina, represents Argentina and its people. This print is one that is very personal to me, as Operation Condor forced my grandparents and my father to flee Argentina. American interventionism caused my mother to leave Peru at a young age as well. This piece was self-directed.</p>
