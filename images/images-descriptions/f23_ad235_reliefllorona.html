        <p>This print was the result of an assignment, of which the motive was to depict a story from your childhood. I decided to depict the legend of La Llorona, a staple legend told to Latinx children about the ghost of a woman whose children drowned in a river. Her spirit wanders on, crying for her lost children, and according to legend anyone who comes across her is doomed to the same watery demise. The piece itself was based off of a picture I took at myself in costume by the Huron River.</p>
