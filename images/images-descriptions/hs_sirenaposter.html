        <h3><i>MEDIUM:</i> India ink drawing with gold leaf on paper</h3>
        <!--width x height-->
        <h3><i>DIMENSIONS:</i> n in x n in</h3>  
        <p>This drawing was a continued exploration of the staple Mexican game, La Loteria, whose visuals I had previously incorporated into my work. This piece is a spin on the sixth card– La Sirena, or the Mermaid– depicting her as a bony, fish-like beast rather than a beautiful, woman-like entity. A pen was dipped into a pot of India ink in order to achieve the fine details in this drawing, while the background was filled in carefully with a paintbrush, after which gold leaf was added as an embellishment.</p>
