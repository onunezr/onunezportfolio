        <p>These prints reflect American individualism as well as cultural homogeneity. The faces depicted in the prints all look similar despite being different, and their shapes fit together, yet they are all separated. This is supposed to represent the lack of originality that comes with this cultural homogeneity, yet how individualistic we are, and how that can have negative effects in our community. When individualism is as intense as it is here in the United States, it leads to feelings of loneliness as well as greed, which is evident especially during the pandemic among the people who refuse to social distance and wear masks because it is inconvenient to them specifically. Having lived in Latin American countries during my formative years, American individualism harmed me especially when I moved back to the United States, because the sense of community that exists in Latin America is one that is nonexistent in the USA. As a result, this led to a deep feeling of isolation that has persisted for the four years since I moved back to Michigan.</p>
