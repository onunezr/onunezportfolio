        <p>This painting depicts my grandparents holding my little sister circa 2007 in Argentina. As a child, I visited Argentina very frequently because of my grandparents, and I lived there for a year as well. Argentine culture is an important part of my identity as well as Mexican culture, and the frequent times I visited Argentina as a child definitely helped form me into the person that I am today. I chose to use earthier and more muted colors for this piece because my grandparents lived away from the city, where the climate was dry and fields and mountains were prominent. I also chose to use more muted colors for some elements of the painting such as the background to show that this painting was based on distant memories. This piece was self-directed.</p>
